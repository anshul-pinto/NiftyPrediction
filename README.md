Predicting the Price of Nifty50 Index
</br>
I implemented a LSTM network using keras. Currently working on improving the model. Current prediction graph is lagging behind the labels because of not accounting for look-back period. Model seems to be overfitting.

Ideas to imrove:
1. Use more features including technical analysis indicators
2. Use cross validation
